#DSA
I already have studied the algorithms of stack,queue and Binary Search Tree from my academics so I converted it into python code. 
For stack and queue I have simply created a list and done the operations, But for the Binary Search Tree we have to use class to create node. 
#Anagram-checker
To check whether two given string is anagram or not
In this i have used a function that sort the string, after sorting we will check if both the string matches or not if both the string matches it is an anagram otherwise it is not
#FizzBuzz-And-Fibonacci
FizzBuzz
Python function that takes in an integer n and prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
for this i checked the divisibility of the number by 3 and 5 using % operator in an if-elif-else
Fibonacci
Python function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones
